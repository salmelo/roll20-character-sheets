### Plans & Info

## Plans
* Fix Top info section of sheet to compress when page is shrunk
* 
[done]* Make Inventory Section
[done]* Include more fields for Feats, Perks, & Flaws
	[done]+ Plus ability to click to roll them so all can see info about
[done]* Include Inventory into speed (how it affects)
[done]* Creation of a "fancy (advanced)" version of the sheet
	+ More optimization for web (and potentially mobile)
	+ Sections that disappear with a click
* A settings section where you could modify certain values
	+ For "homebrew" and if changes come up before final release of product
* A rolltemplete that isn't using the default
	+ Adding in a pop-up for target CR to caculate and do the math if you hit & damage
* Clean up the CSS code
	- Currently includes a lot from a previous sheet I was using, some code doesn't apply

## Info
* Javascript is employed to auto calculate nearly every field
	+ Dice are determined based on Attribute values
		- Needs to be fixed if values higher than 9 are entered
	+ Hit Points are auto calculated
	+ Total points spent on Attributes calculate
	+ Evasion, Toughness, & Resolve auot calculated
	+ Feat & Attribute points auto calculated based on XP
	+ Level determined based on XP
		- Needs to have something to indicate max value for Attributes based on level

* This basic version was designed to aesthetically look like the Charactersheet provided by Open Legends
	+ Certain design designed are done based on this, only planning to add a few things like inventory
	+ The Advanced version (in developement) will have more robust use to it
	+ Created this because notes indicate the Roll20 Charactersheet is in the "icebox" by developers at the moment.
		- If they put out one, may stop working on this and use theirs, or just focus on advanced version.
